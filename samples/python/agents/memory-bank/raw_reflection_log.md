TaskRef: "Refactor docstring_audit_agent to use ADK and google-generativeai, fix streaming error"

Learnings:
- Attempted to fix `KeyError: '$defs'` during ADK agent response streaming.
- Modified prompt in `docstring_audit_agent_adk/agent.py` to inline JSON schema and then to use a simplified JSON example to influence LLM output format.
- Modified agent's `stream` method to yield report as a plain text string (`str(final_report.model_dump())`) instead of a JSON string (`json.dumps(...)`) to bypass `task_manager`'s streaming JSON parsing.
- Encountered persistent streaming error in `task_manager` (`KeyError: '$defs'` and later `KeyError: '\n "discrepancies"'`) despite modifications to agent output.
- Learned that `google-genai` is the correct package name for the Google AI Python library, not `google-generativeai`.
- Successfully created a new Cline rule file using the `new_rule` tool.
- Captured user preferences regarding development workflow, debugging, and communication style based on conversation history for the new rule file.

Difficulties:
- Persistent streaming errors originating from the ADK `task_manager` when processing the agent's yielded content.
- Inability to directly debug or modify the internal logic of the ADK `task_manager`.
- `replace_in_file` tool failing multiple times due to subtle content mismatches, requiring fallback to `write_to_file` for file modifications.
- Initial attempts to run the agent failed due to the address being already in use, requiring user intervention to stop the previous process.
- None in creating the rule file itself.

Successes:
- Successfully modified the `docstring_audit_agent_adk/agent.py` file using both `replace_in_file` and `write_to_file` tools to implement changes to the prompt and the output streaming logic.
- Successfully identified that the root cause of the persistent streaming error appears to be within the ADK framework's handling of streamed responses, rather than the agent's logic or LLM output itself.
- Successfully created the `development-workflow.md` rule file in the correct location with the specified content and format.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When encountering persistent streaming JSON parsing errors in a framework's task manager, consider yielding output as plain text if possible to bypass the framework's parser.
- Specific issue: ADK `task_manager` may have issues with incremental JSON parsing of streamed content, potentially related to `$defs` or formatting, even with inlined schemas or simplified output. Requires further investigation within the ADK framework itself.
- Tool usage: Be prepared to use `write_to_file` as a fallback when `replace_in_file` consistently fails, especially with complex or auto-formatted files.
- Rule creation: Successfully used the `new_rule` tool to capture user-specific development preferences.
